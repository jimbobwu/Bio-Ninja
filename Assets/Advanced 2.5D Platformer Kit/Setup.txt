How to setup:
The easiest way to setup the platformer kit is to duplicate the Player object in the demo scene.

Instructions to setup from scratch:
- Create a cube that resembles the size of the player (I usually go with 1 width and 1.5-2 height)
- Add a rigidbody component to the cube.
- Turn 'Use gravity' OFF
- Turn ON freeze position for the Z axis (since we are doing a 2.5D game)
- Turn ON freeze rotations for all 3 axes
- Apply the 'nofriction' physic material to the box collider of the object
- Apply the PlatformerPhysics.cs script (The cube will now have platformer physics)
- Apply the PlatformerController.cs script if you want to control the player with the keyboard
- Apply the PlatformerAnimation.cs script if you want the player to have animations triggered (Please note you need to link a model that will be animated, and the model needs a couple of specific animations to function properly)
